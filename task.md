# What this task is about?

The goal of this task is to use the Open3D library to display the lidar point-cloud in a 3d viewer in order to develop a feel for the nature of lidar point-clouds. A detailed description of all required steps can be found in the code.

When the code is functional, you are supposed to use the viewer to locate and closely inspect point-clouds on vehicles and write a short report that includes the following items:

* Find and display 6 examples of vehicles with varying degrees of visibility in the point-cloud
* Identify vehicle features that appear as a stable feature on most vehicles (e.g. rear-bumper, tail-lights) and describe them briefly.
  Also, use the range image viewer from the last example to underpin your findings using the  lidar intensity channel.

## What your result should look like
